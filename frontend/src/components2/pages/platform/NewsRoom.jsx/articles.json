        "introduction": [
          "When I first started working in digital marketing and visual design across the Caribbean, I noticed something fundamental was missing from most educational platforms: they didn't look or feel like they were made for us. The colors were muted, the imagery generic, the cultural references foreign. Learning materials designed in Silicon Valley or Europe might have technical excellence, but they lacked soul—they didn't speak our visual language or understand our context.",
          "In Haiti and across the Caribbean, visual communication isn't just decoration; it's a vital part of how we share knowledge. From the vibrant tap-tap buses that tell stories through art to the colorful markets where every arrangement communicates value, we understand information through rich, expressive visuals. Yet most e-learning platforms offer sterile interfaces that feel disconnected from our reality.",
          "At E-strateji, we're changing that. Every course interface, every lesson layout, every color palette is designed with Caribbean visual literacy in mind."

            "content": [
              "We use colors that reflect our landscapes—the deep blues of our coastlines, the vibrant greens of our mountains, the warm tones of our architecture. Our illustrations feature people who look like our learners, in settings that feel familiar rather than foreign.",
              "But visual design is about more than aesthetics; it's about accessibility. Many of our learners access courses on mobile devices with limited data plans. We optimize every image, use efficient color schemes that work on various screen qualities, and ensure that visual elements enhance understanding rather than distract from it. A well-designed diagram can replace paragraphs of text, making complex concepts accessible even with limited bandwidth."

              "Cultural context is equally crucial. We're building bilingual interfaces that seamlessly switch between Kreyòl and English, recognizing that many Caribbean learners think and learn in multiple languages. Our course materials include local examples and case studies—when teaching business fundamentals, we might use examples from Haitian entrepreneurs or Jamaican small business owners rather than generic international corporations.",
              "One of our most exciting projects is developing visual frameworks for traditionally text-heavy subjects. How do you make civics engaging? Through interactive timelines of Caribbean history, visual maps showing political structures, and character-driven stories that make governance relatable. How do you teach financial literacy? Through culturally relevant scenarios and visual budgeting tools that reflect local economic realities."
